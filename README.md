# GDP Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize GDP (Gross Domestic Product) prediction data spanning from 1960 to 2030. Various analyses, including data manipulation, summary statistics calculation, regression modeling, clustering techniques, and visualization, are performed to gain insights into GDP trends and distributions over time.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- **GDP Prediction Analysis.R**: R script containing code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Prediction_GDP1960_2030.csv**: CSV file containing GDP prediction data from 1960 to 2030.
- **README.md**: Markdown file providing information about the project.

## Dependencies

The following R libraries are used in this project:

- dplyr
- ggplot2
- tidyr
- caret
- cluster
- gridExtra

Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the R script.

## Running the Analysis

1. Ensure R is installed on your system.
2. Install the required R libraries using `install.packages()`.
3. Download the project files.
4. Open the R script `GDP Prediction Analysis.R` in RStudio or any other R environment.
5. Run the script to perform data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

## File Descriptions

- **GDP Prediction Analysis.R**: This script contains the code for preprocessing the GDP prediction data, performing various analyses (such as linear regression, clustering), and visualizing the results using ggplot2 and other R packages.
- **Prediction_GDP1960_2030.csv**: This CSV file contains the GDP prediction data from 1960 to 2030, which is used as input for the analysis.

## Output

The output of the analysis includes:

- Summary statistics of GDP data.
- Visualization of GDP distributions over the years.
- Regression analysis to predict future GDP values.
- Clustering analysis to identify patterns in GDP data.
- Various plots and charts depicting GDP trends and distributions.
