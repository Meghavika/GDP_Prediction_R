# GDP Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) trends using data spanning from 1960 to 2030. The analysis involves preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building machine learning models for GDP prediction, and visualizing the results.

## Project Structure

The project directory includes the following files:

- **GDP_Prediction_Analysis.R**: R script containing code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, and visualization.
- **Prediction_GDP1960_2030.csv**: CSV file containing GDP prediction data from 1960 to 2030.
- **README.md**: Markdown file providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the analysis.

## Dependencies

To run the analysis, ensure you have the following R libraries installed:

- dplyr
- ggplot2
- tidyr
- caret
- randomForest
- zoo
- gsubfn
- forecast
- kableExtra
- cluster
- gridExtra
- gridBase
- shiny
- shinythemes
- leaflet
- plotly
- shinyalert
- readr

You can install these packages using the `install.packages()` function in R.

## Running the Analysis

Follow these steps to run the analysis:

1. Install R and R Studio on your system if you haven't already.
2. Install the required R libraries listed above.
3. Download the project files to your local machine.
4. Run the scripts to preprocess the data, perform exploratory analysis, build machine learning models, and visualize the results.

## Output

The output of the analysis includes:

- Summary statistics of GDP data.
- Visualization of GDP distributions over the years.
- Machine learning models for predicting future GDP values.
- Clustering analysis to identify patterns in GDP data.
- Various plots and charts depicting GDP trends and distributions.
